    <ul style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;color:blue;font-size:300%;"> Core Ideas of Computer Science
  <li>    </li>
  <li> function- abstraction of hard coding </li>
  <li> ie. happybirthday.py print("Happy Birthday to you!"). </li>
  <li> From that point on when you want a sprite to do something, you just use the function instead of hard coding it everytime. A real life example would be moving your fingers. Your mind does not go through the hard coding in your brain to complete the action. It has become something you don't think about in that way like a function.</li>
  <li>    </li>
  <li> variable- an input that gives a patterned output </li>
  <li> ie. counter = 100 # An integer assignment print counter. </li>
  <li> A real life example would be an assigned number to a person in a classroom. </li>
  <li>    </li>
  <li> loop- a repeated action </li>
  <li> ie. for x in range(0, 3): print "We're on time %d" % (x). </li>
  <li> A real life example would be blinking that happens every so often.</li> 
  <li>    </li>
  <li> conditional- an action contingent upon another action like an if then statement.</li>
  <li> ie. if condition_1:statement_block_1 elif condition_2: statement_block_2 else:statement_block_3.</li>
  <li> A real life example would be if you get a good night's sleep, then you will be energized the next day.</li>
