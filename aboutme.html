     <p style="color:red;"> I was born in Nashville, Tennessee on July 8, 2000. Right now I am 16 years old and a rising senior at Ravenwood High School. My hobbies include speech & debate, Model UN, Youth in Government, and National History Day. I love learning about politics and governments around the world. </p>
