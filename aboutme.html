     <p style="color:blue;font-family: 'Pacifico', cursive;"> I was born in Nashville, Tennessee on July 8, 2000. Right now I am 16 years old and a rising senior at Ravenwood High School. My hobbies include speech & debate, Model UN, Youth in Government, and National History Day. I love learning about politics and governments around the world. I believe it is vital to our well being to care about what is happening around us.  </p>

    <p style="color:blue;font-family: 'Pacifico', cursive;"> function- abstraction of hard coding ie. happybirthday.py print("Happy Birthday to you!")print("Happy Birthday to you!")print("Happy Birthday, dear Emily.")print("Happy Birthday to you!"). From that point on when you want a sprite to do something, you just use the function instead of hard coding it everytime. A real life example would be moving your fingers. Your mind does not go through the hard coding in your brain to complete the action. It has become something you don't think about in that way ergo a function. variable- an input that gives a patterned output ie. counter = 100 # An integer assignment print counter. A real life example would be an assigned number to a person in a classroom. loop- a repeated action for x in range(0, 3): print "We're on time %d" % (x). A real life example would be blinking that happens every so often. conditional- if then statement. ie if condition_1:statement_block_1 elif condition_2: statement_block_2 else:statement_block_3. A real life example would be if you get a good night's sleep, then you will be energized the next day.</p>
