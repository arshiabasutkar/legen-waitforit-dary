  <body style="background-color:powderblue;">
     <p style="color:purple;font-family: 'Pacifico', cursive;"> I was born in Nashville, Tennessee on July 8, 2000. Right now I am 16 years old and a rising senior at Ravenwood High School. My hobbies include speech & debate, Model UN, Youth in Government, and National History Day. I love learning about politics and governments around the world. I believe it is vital to our well being to care about what is happening around us.  </p>
